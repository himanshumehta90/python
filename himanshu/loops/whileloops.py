#loops are used to repeat instructions: while loops and for loops

i = 1 #iterators
while i<=5: #iteration
    print("hello", i) #will prinit the itration number as well
    i+=1

#WAP to print sequence of number starting from 1

i=1
while i<=5 :

#WAP to print sequence of number starting from 5 in reverse order

while i>=1:

#WAP to print numbers from 1 to 100
